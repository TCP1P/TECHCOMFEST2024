    TCP1P is offering a complimentary exam and certification to evaluate your expertise in mobile application security. Your task is to analyze the Notes Manager application within a provided pre-configured Android image. The exam consists of three main questions:
    ```
    1. What is the login credential for the Notes Manager application in the pre-configured device?
    2. What is the content of Secret Note #1?
    3. What is the content of Secret Note #2?
    ```
    Additionally, you'll receive the Notes Manager app for testing purposes in your personal Android setup.

    Please note that the provided pre-configured Android image lacks root access. This is a deliberate choice to mimic real-world conditions. Rooting the provided image is not permitted, as the necessary exploits for this exam don't require root access. However, you may perform dynamic analysis in a rooted environment on your device.

    Best of luck with your exam!

    Regards,
    Aimar Sechan Adhitya, Head of TCP1P Exam & Certification Program.
